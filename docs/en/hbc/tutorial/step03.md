# Step 3 - Selecting the type of cladding

The choice of cladding type depends on requirements for appearance, durability, thermal insulation, acoustic insulation, cost and other factors.

## Trapezoidal and corrugated sheets
Trapezoidal and corrugated sheets are commonly used materials for cladding halls. They are steel sheets with a specific forming that gives them rigidity and strength. Trapezoidal sheets have the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to install. In addition, they are available in a variety of colours and designs so that the ones that best match the project requirements can be selected. Trapezoidal sheets do not provide any thermal insulation and are therefore only suitable for unheated halls.

## Cassette cladding
Cassette cladding is mainly used in modern halls. It is a modular system that combines a lightweight steel structure with cladding made of sandwich panels or composite materials. Cassette cladding is a set of large cassette elements that are placed side by side to form the overall fa√ßade of the hall.

This type of cladding allows for a variety of cassette shapes and sizes to be used, creating a unique look for each hall. The cassette cladding also allows for better thermal insulation and acoustic absorption, which increases the comfort inside the hall. Furthermore, this type of cladding is relatively easy to maintain and is weather resistant. The disadvantages may be the higher purchase price compared to other types of cladding and the complexity of installation.

## Sandwich panels
Sandwich panels are a very popular type of cladding for steel halls. These panels consist of two metal plates (usually steel) and a core of insulating material (e.g. mineral wool, polystyrene foam or PUR foam). These panels are manufactured in different thicknesses and lengths to meet specific requirements for insulation, fire resistance and other factors.

The benefits of sandwich panels are multifaceted. They are lightweight and easy to assemble, allowing for quick and efficient installation. With an insulating core, they provide excellent thermal insulation and reduce heating and cooling costs in the hall. They are resistant to moisture, weather conditions and fire, increasing the safety and durability of the building.
The disadvantage of sandwich panels can be their limited variability in design, which can lead to a similar hall appearance to other halls with this type of cladding. They can also be prone to damage and wear, which can cause insulation problems.

### Panel laying direction
The horizontal or vertical laying direction of sandwich panels should be chosen with respect to the type of secondary structure. Where there is a requirement for horizontal panel laying, in many cases there is no need for a secondary structure. If the requirement is for vertical or general direction of panel placement, a secondary structure should be used to provide support for the panels and proper load distribution to the primary hall structure.

## Timber cladding
Wood paneling gives the hall a pleasing aesthetic. It can consist of either wooden planks that are attached to the secondary structure of the hall, or wooden decking that is attached to sandwich panels.

When using timber decking, it is important to ensure that it is properly maintained and protected from the weather. Timber should be impregnated and varnished to prolong its life and minimise the effects of moisture and sunlight.

Halls with wooden cladding are built, for example, by [Binz](https://www.holzbau-binz.de/).

## Colour schemes
The sandwich panels are available in a variety of colours and designs, so it is possible to choose a suitable colour scheme for the hall cladding to match the surrounding environment or to match the corporate visual identity. Manufacturers offer a wide range of colours and finishes, including matt, gloss, smooth or textured surfaces.
