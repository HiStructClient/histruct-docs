# Step 2 - Internal layout and modules

## Distances between columns and frames
The columns of the primary structure should be spaced so as not to impede the movement of trucks or material handling equipment within the hall. Ideally, columns should be spaced to create the largest possible space free of obstructions. It is not always possible to create clear space without using internal columns.

The spacing between frames depends on the required load capacity of the structure, the type and size of materials used and the local climatic conditions. All these factors must be taken into account in the design of the hall.

## Replacements
If you plan to use larger doors or entrance gates on the side of the hall, you may consider using exchanges to transfer the load around the opening in the structure. When designing an interchange, it is important to consider the load capacity and stability requirements of the structure.

## Interior walls
Interior walls should be located so that they are not disturbed by the primary structure and are easily adaptable to production or storage needs.
