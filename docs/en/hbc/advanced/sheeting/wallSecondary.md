# Secondary construction of curtain walls

The secondary wall cladding structure is the part of the hall structure that distributes the loads from the wall panels to the primary structure, especially the columns. The choice of secondary structure depends on the chosen cladding. When panels with sufficient load-bearing capacity are laid horizontally (e.g. PUR panels), the spreading function can be taken over directly by the panels and the use of a secondary structure may not be required.

The configurator allows for detailed adjustment of the secondary structure. By default, the type of secondary structure is selected according to the direction of laying the cladding.

Available settings:

- Secondary structure location
 - Secondary structure on the outside of the frames
 - Secondary structure on the inside of the frames
 - Framing around openings only
 - Without secondary structure

- Armpit profile

- Spacing between armpits

- Preferred locations
