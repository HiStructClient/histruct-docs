# Trim generator and gutter system

It is mainly designed to **save time** for making 3d model of flashings and gutters for imported or specified roof plane geometries.

The generator can also be used in general for plane geometries that are entered from a drawing or completely by hand and just spaced to best fit the edges of the roof planes to be touched. It does not have to fit completely, just fit within normal tolerances.

HiStruct recognizes the necessary fringe locations from the geometries of the nearby roof planes and generates the fringe from the selected types. The generated fringes can be further modified.
