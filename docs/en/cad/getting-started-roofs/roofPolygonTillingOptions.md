# Cladding options

Depending on the type of cladding chosen for a particular roof or wall area, the appropriate generator is selected. Each type of generator may have a specific control.

## Sheet metal strip generator

The sheet metal strip generator places the selected covering along the base of the area. The generator can be set for the entire cladding area or, some settings are then available by clicking on an individual strip. In the editing mode, the proportion of the total strip area to the sheathed area is always displayed.

### The angle of the laying of the strips

It is adjustable as positive or negative offset from the baseline.

- overlay in appropriate places (according to the grid of the slats) Clicking on the indicated divisions above the slats can split the strip or, conversely, merge it if it has already been split.

## Lengthening or shortening panels at the sides

For each side of the roof polygon, you can set the panel lengthening or shortening by clicking on the button above the edge.
