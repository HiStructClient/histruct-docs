# Cladding options

Depending on the type of cladding chosen for a particular roof or wall area, the appropriate generator is selected. Each type of generator may have its specific controls.

## Sheet strips generator

The sheet strips generator places the chosen roofing material along the slope of the surface. The generator can be configured for the entire claded area, or some settings are available by clicking on individual strips. In editing mode, the proportion of the total area covered by the strips to the clad area is always displayed.
