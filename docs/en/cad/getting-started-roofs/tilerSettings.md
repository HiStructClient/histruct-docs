# üõ†Ô∏è Quick and easy to use roof strip generator

The Roof Strip Generator places the selected roofing material along the flat surface. The generator can be set for the entire sheathed area or, some settings are available by clicking on an individual strip. In the editing mode, the proportion of the total strip area to the sheathed area is always displayed.
