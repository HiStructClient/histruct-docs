# 🔄 Quick PDF to DXF conversion

The most common format for sharing drawings is PDF, but it does not allow further editing. However, it is possible to convert a PDF drawing to DXF. Such a format can already be edited, but more importantly used as a basis for HiStruct. Here is a list of online tools for this conversion that are free:

1. [HiPDF](https://www.hipdf.com/en/pdf-to-dxf)
2. [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/pdf-to-dxf)
3. [AnyConv](https://anyconv.com/pdf-to-dxf-converter/)

Or even desktop applications:

1. [AnyDWG](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDCXWGXBPBV?ocid=pdpshare)

You can then use the generated DXF files for [import](importDxf.md) into HiStruct.
