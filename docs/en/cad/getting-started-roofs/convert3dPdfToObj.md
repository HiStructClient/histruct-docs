# ðŸ”„ Easy conversion of 3D model from PDF to OBJ
If you have a 3D model in PDF format and want to work with it or use it in HiStruct, you will need to convert it to OBJ format, which is supported in HiStruct. This process is not difficult and can be done by almost anyone.

## Conversion using online tools
There are several online tools that allow you to convert such models. For example:

1. [Aspose 3D PDF to OBJ Converter](https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/pdf-to-obj)
2. [ImageToSTL PDF to OBJ Converter](https://imagetostl.com/convert/file/pdf/to/obj)

## Convert using paid applications
If you need to convert such files on a regular basis, you may consider using paid applications that offer more features and support. These include:

1. [Tetra4D](https://tetra4d.com/)
2. [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya)


You can then use the generated model in OBJ format to [import](importObj.md) into HiStruct.
