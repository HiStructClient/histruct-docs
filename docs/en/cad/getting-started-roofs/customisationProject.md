# Customizing HiStruct

The installation system for roof tilings, flashings, and the gutter system is set up separately for each specific producer in a dedicated configuration file. It includes information on how the roof area is to be installed with roofing, possible color combinations, details on the bill of materials (part numbers), and more.
These configuration files are created as part of a customisation project, during which we tailor the configurator to the producer with their specific product offering.

## What do we customize?

- Configuration files for roofing, flashings, and the gutter system
- Geometries of individual components, textures, and maps if necessary
- Settings for the successful generation of the bill of materials, including available geometry, general elements without geometric representation, fasteners, underlayers, etc.
- Outputs according to the producer's requirements, including bills of materials, quotations, drawings, views, exports, etc.
- Integration with pricing via API to the producer's existing system
- Integration with the producer's ecosystem, including quotation exports, connection to ERP, and additional functionalities as required
