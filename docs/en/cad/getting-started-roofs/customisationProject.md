# Customizing HiStruct

The installation system for roof fittings, flashings, flashings and gutter system is set up separately for each specific manufacturer in a separate configuration file. It contains information on how the roof area is to be stacked with fittings, possible colour combinations, information on the bill of materials (part numbers) and more.
These configuration files are created as part of a customisation project, during which we tailor the configurator to the manufacturer with their specific product offering.

## What do we customize?

- Configuration files for available roofing, flashings, flashings, gutter system
- geometries of individual components, textures, maps if necessary
- Settings for successful generation of the bill of materials from the available geometry, general elements without geometric representation, fasteners, underlayers, etc.
- outputs according to manufacturer's requirements, bills of materials, quotations, drawings, views, exports, etc.
- Connection to pricing via API to the manufacturer's existing system
- Connection to the manufacturer's ecosystem, quotation exports, connection to ERP and more as required
