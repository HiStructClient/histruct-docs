<h1>Cladding &gt; Building &gt; Roof</h1>

<p>In the <u><i>Cladding &gt; Building &gt; Roof</i></u> menu, you can set the roof composition type, the type of roofing, and the dimensions of the secondary roof structure.</p>

<p>Within each individual roof plane, you can also change the direction of roofing layout, generate a bill of materials for the roofing items, and generate a roof structure floor plan in the form of an editable drawing.</p>

<p><b>The settings and adjustments of individual roof planes can be made using <u>Control and Edit buttons</u>.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>With <u>Control buttons</u> in the model, you can set the type of roof composition, the type of roofing, and the dimensions of the secondary structure elements separately for each roof plane; they also allow you to create material reports and roof structure drawings.</p></li>
  <li><p>With <u>Edit buttons</u> in the model, you can edit the properties of individual roof structure layers on a specified roof plane; they also allow you to create material reports and drawings of the relevant layers of the roof structure.</p></li>
</ul>
