# Sheeting > Roof Plane

<p>In the <u><i>Sheeting > Roof Plane</i></u> menu accessible via the <u>Control button</u>, it is possible for each roof plane to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Set the type of roof composition - covering type and secondary structure.</p></li>
  <li><p>Generate a bill of materials with roof covering items and also generate a plan of the roof structure with all layers as an editable drawing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Control and Edit buttons</u> modify the properties of the roof structure only for the selected roof plane.</b></p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/EditPropertiesIcon64x64.png", "Properties", "Properties") }}

<p>The <u>Properties</u> button allows you to name the specified roof plane and adjust the roof eccentricity, i.e., the offset of the generated roof plane from its actual position.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/WallPartIcon64x64.png", "Materials", "Materials") }}

<p>The roof structure composition is set using the buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><u>Top layer</u></p></li>
  <li><p><u>Lower layers</u></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
For some coverings, the <u>Lower layers</u> button may be hidden by default, and the secondary structure is therefore not generated for such a covering.
</p> 

<hr>

{{ box_icon("img/RoofTopLayer_64x64.png", "Top layer", "Top layer", fontSize=10) }}
<ul>
  <li><p>Allows you to select a roof covering from a prepared gallery of products.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

{{ box_icon("img/RoofLowerLayers_64x64.png", "Lower layers", "Lower layers", fontSize=10) }}
<ul>
  <li><p>Allows you to select the type of secondary structure composition from a prepared gallery of products.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/BomIcon64x64.png", "BOM", "Bill of Materials") }}

<p>Generates a list of roof covering items for the respective roof plane in a clear table.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/MainDrawings64x64.png", "Drawing", "Drawing") }}

<p>Generates a drawing of the specified roof plane including the entire composition of the roof structure. The drawing can be further edited, supplemented with annotations and dimensions.</p>
