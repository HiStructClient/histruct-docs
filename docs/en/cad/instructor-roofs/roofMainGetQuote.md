#### Are you a roofing manufacturer?

HiStruct Roofs can be extensively customized. The system for laying roof tiles, flashings, gutters is set up separately for each specific manufacturer in a separate set of configuration files. It contains information on how the roof area is to be laid with tiles or strips, possible color combinations, information on the bill of materials and more. These and other customizations are done within [customization project](../getting-started-roofs/customisationProject.md).

[Get in touch](https://www.histruct.com/company/contact-us) with us and we'll be happy to go over your questions with you.
