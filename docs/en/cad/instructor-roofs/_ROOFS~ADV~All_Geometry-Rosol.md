# Geometry &gt; Rosol

<p>
In the <u><i>Geometry &gt; Rosol</i></u> menu, you can adjust the dimensions and slopes of the generated edges and surfaces using the ROSOL solver.
</p>

<hr class="main">

<h2>Editing the geometry of roof edges and surfaces using the ROSOL solver</h2>

<p>
After editing the generator settings in the <u><i>Geometry &gt; Import</i></u> menu, we now have the generated roof edges and planes with the corresponding dimensions and slopes.
</p>

<p>
Directly in the model, it is now possible to adjust the type, length, and even enforce horizontality of roof edges. For roof surfaces, it is possible to modify their slope.
</p>
<p>
<b>Edits can be made in the table that opens after clicking on the corresponding edge or surface.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Some edits may not be compatible with the permissible results from the solver and therefore cannot be made.</b>
</p>

<p>
By editing the geometry of individual edges and surfaces, the geometry of the entire model changes. Dimensions you want to keep can be locked using the padlock symbol.
