# Libraries
This panel hides all the key libraries used in our model. Here you will find the *Surfaces* library, which contains the colors and textures of the elements in the model. Another interesting library is the [*Flashing Library*](../getting-started-roofs/roofFlashingLibrary.md), where you can choose from a variety of shapes, colors, and types of fringing. Finally, we have the *Materials* library, which allows you to define roofing materials but also entire wall compositions. Explore our rich libraries and customize your model to your liking!
