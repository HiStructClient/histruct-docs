# Geometry &gt; Building

<p>Allows you to change the geometric parameters of the model, i.e. the building and roof dimensions, including pitch and overhangs. You can also set the roof composition type here.</p>

<p><b><u>Control buttons</u> adjust the construction properties only on the selected roof or wall plane.</b></p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/Sheated_Building_Page_Building.png", "Dimensions", "Dimensions") }}

<p>The <u>Dimensions</u> button is used to draw the floor plan shape of the building, set the building height and roof pitch, and also to add openings into the roof structure.</p>

<p>The basic floor plan dimensions can be entered either for the roof structure or for the vertical walls.</p>

<hr class="main">

<!--{{ box_icon("img/RoofSketchIcon64x64.png", "Roof", "Roof") }}

<p>The <u>Roof</u> button allows you to set the type of roof composition. The type of cladding and the dimensions of the secondary roof structure can be changed via the <u>Cladding</u> button.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/WallIcon64x64.png", "Walls", "Walls") }}

<p>The <u>Walls</u> button allows you to set the wall alignment, type of wall fabrication, arrangement of cladding rows, and plinth height.</p>

<p>These settings can be adjusted for individual walls using the relevant Control buttons.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/MainInsert64x64.png", "Add wall 2D", "Add wall 2D", fontSize=8) }}

<p>The <u>Add wall 2D</u> button allows you to add internal vertical walls to the structure and modify wall properties.</p>

<!--<p><b><u>Roof plane control button</u></b> allows you to set the type of roof composition for each roof plane.</p>-->

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/ControlButtonComponent.png", "", "Basic component control button", width=64) }}

<p><b><u>Basic wall component control button</u></b> allows you to set the fabrication type and arrangement of wall division.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/ControlButtonComponentPart.png", "", "Control button for split component", width=64) }}

<p>Depending on the number of split levels of the original wall component, the component control button expandsâ€”this allows you to adjust the same properties on the entire original wall component or on its various parts, or to further divide individual parts and create further levels of the original wall component.</p>

<p>The lowest level of the split component is controlled using the central part of the button, and higher levels always with the outer parts around the edge of the button.</p>
