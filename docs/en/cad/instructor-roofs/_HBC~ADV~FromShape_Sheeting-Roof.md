# Cladding &gt; Roof

<p>In the <u><i>Cladding &gt; Roof</i></u> menu, it is possible to set the type of roof composition, the type of roofing, and the dimensions of the secondary roof structure.</p>

<p>Within individual roof planes, it is also possible to change the direction of laying the roofing, generate a bill of materials with roofing items, and also generate a plan of the roof structure in the form of an editable drawing.</p>

<p><b>Settings and adjustments for individual roof planes can be made using <u>Control and Edit buttons</u>.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Via the <u>Control buttons</u> in the model, you can set the type of roof composition, roofing type, and dimensions of secondary construction elements separately for each roof plane. They also allow you to create material reports and drawings of the roof structure.</p></li>
  <li><p>Via the <u>Edit buttons</u> in the model, you can edit the properties of individual layers of the roof structure on a selected roof plane. They also allow you to create material reports and drawings for the relevant layers of the roof structure.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Settings of Roof Structure Layers</h2>
<p>The composition setup of the roof structure is done using the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><u>Top layer</u></p></li>
  <li><p><u>Lower layers</u></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
For some roofings, the <u>Lower layers</u> button may be hidden by default, and the secondary structure for such roofing is then not generated.
