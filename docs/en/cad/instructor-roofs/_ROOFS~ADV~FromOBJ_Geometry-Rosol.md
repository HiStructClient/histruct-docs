# Geometry &gt; Rosol
<p>In the <u><i>Geometry &gt; Rosol</i></u> menu, it is possible to adjust the dimensions and slopes of the generated roof edges and surfaces using the ROSOL solver.</p>

<hr class="main">

<h2>Editing the geometry of roof edges and surfaces using the ROSOL solver</h2>
<p>After adjusting the generator settings in the <u><i>Geometry &gt; Import</i></u> menu, we now have generated roof edges and planes with the appropriate dimensions and slopes.</p>
<p>Directly in the model, it is now possible to modify the type, length, and, if necessary, enforce the horizontality of the roof edges; for roof surfaces, it is possible to adjust their slope.</p>
<p><b>Edits can be made in the table that opens after clicking on the relevant edge or surface.</b></p>
<p><b>Some modifications may be incompatible with the allowable results from the solver, and such changes cannot be made.</b></p>
<p>By editing the geometry of individual edges and surfaces, the geometry of the entire model will change. You can lock the dimensions you want to preserve using the padlock symbol.</p>

{{ box_icon("img/StartOverIcon64x64.png", "Start Over", "Start Over") }}
</p>
<p>The <u>Start Over</u> button can be used to delete all user modifications to the geometry and return to the original solver result.</p>
