# Geometry
<p>
Allows you to draw roof planes, modify their shapes, dimensions, or slopes.
</p>

<p><b>For a clearer workflow, the content of the <u>Geometry</u> menu differs for the phase before drawing the first surface and the phase after drawing the first surface.</b></p>

<p>
<b><u>Edit buttons</u> adjust properties of the roof structure only on the selected roof plane.</b>

# Geometry
<p>
Allows you to draw roof planes, modify their shapes, dimensions, or slopes, and also set the type of roof composition.

{{ box_icon("img/ImportDxfIcon64x64.png", "Background", "Background") }}

<p>The <u>Background</u> button is used to import a background for faster drawing of the roof outline.</p> 

<p>After importing the background, you need to check its dimensions and adjust the scale if necessary.</p>

<p><b><u>Adjusting the imported background scale</u></b></p>

<ul>
<p><li>
After clicking on the grid of the imported background, you can change the scale directly in the corresponding cell in the opened table. 
</li></p>

<p><li>
To adjust the scale, you can also use the <u>Scale</u> button located at the top of the opened table. With this button, you can set the background scale based on a selected edge whose actual dimension is known.
</li></p>
</ul>

{{ box_icon("img/TiledAreaGeneralIcon64x64.png", "Area", "Area") }}

<p>
The <u>Area</u> button is used to draw the floorplan outline of a roof plane. Roof planes can be drawn using predefined area shapes:
</p>

{{ box_icons([
  ("img/GeneralLoopIcon64x64.png", "General"),
  ("img/ClassRectLoopIcon64x64.png", "Rectangle"),
  ("img/ClassTriangleLoopIcon64x64.png", "Triangle"),
  ("img/ClassTrapezoidLoopIcon64x64.png", "Trapezoid"),
], "... and more", width=55, height=55, fontSize=10) }}

<p>
After drawing or inserting an area, its dimensions and slope, as well as the height and direction of the eaves edge, can be modified in the relevant open tableâ€”depending on the area type.
</p>

<hr>

{{ box_icon("img/GeneralLoopIcon64x64.png", "General", "General") }}

  <p>The <u>General</u> button allows you to draw a roof plane of any shape, allowing you to draw both in the floorplan (2D) and the 3D space. You can use:</p>

  <p><b><u>Freehand drawing using the cursor (also possible in 3D space)</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Edges can be drawn by freely clicking in the modeling space.</p></li>
    <li><p>When drawing edges in the floorplan, you can use cursor snapping to the X and Y axes directions, or perpendicular to the last placed edge.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>When drawing a roof surface in 3D space, you must use endpoints of already modeled roof planes, and then change the surface type from PROJECTION -> GENERAL</b>.</p></li>
  </ul>

{{ modal_video_button("img/VideoPlanes3D.mp4") }}

  <p><b><u>Global coordinates of polygon vertices</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Global coordinates for the next vertex are entered in the format "X;Y", e.g. <b>2;4</b></p></li>
  </ul>

{{ modal_video_button("img/VideoPlanesGlobal.mp4") }}

  <p><b><u>Relative coordinates of polygon vertices</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Relative coordinates for the next vertex are entered in the format "@X;Y", e.g. <b>@2;4</b></p></li>
  </ul>

{{ modal_video_button("img/VideoPlanesRelative.mp4") }}

  <p><b><u>Polar coordinates of polygon vertices</u></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Polar coordinates for the next vertex are entered in the format "&gt;alpha;L", e.g. <b>&gt;135;6</b></p></li>
    <li><p>The entered angle is measured from the positive X global axis counterclockwise.</p></li>
  </ul>

{{ modal_video_button("img/VideoPlanesPolar.mp4") }}

  <p>The last inserted point can be deleted using the <b><u>DELETE</u></b> key.</p>

<hr>

{{ box_icon("img/ClassRectLoopIcon64x64.png", "Rectangle", "Rectangle") }}

<p>
A roof plane of rectangular shape can be entered by freely clicking in the floorplan or by its dimensions in the format "X;Y", e.g. <b>2;4</b>.
</p>

<hr>

{{ box_icons([
  ("img/ClassTriangleLoopIcon64x64.png", "Triangle"),
  ("img/ClassTrapezoidLoopIcon64x64.png", "Trapezoid"),

<p>
Roof planes of other shapes can be placed directly by clicking in the modeling space; their dimensions can then be adjusted in the edit table.
</p>

<hr class="main">

<h2>Edit roof planes</h2>

<p><b><u>You can open the table for editing a plane by clicking on the chosen plane.</u></b></p>

<p>
Using the buttons at the top of the table, the area can be copied, deleted, rotated in the floorplan or in the plane, and moved in all three directions.

{{ box_icon("img/ClassRectLoopIcon64x64.png", "Opening", "Opening") }}

<p>
The <u>Opening</u> button allows you to insert an opening into the generated roof plane, drawn as a floorplan projection.
</p>

<p>
An opening can be rectangular or of general shape and can have a chimney opening type assigned.
</p>

<p>
A rectangular opening can be entered by freely clicking in the floorplan or using its dimensions in the format "X;Y", e.g. <b>2;4</b>. An opening of general shape can be drawn freely or using coordinate systems similarly as the outline of the roof structure.
</p>

<p>
After clicking on the relevant opening, you can use the buttons at the top of the open table to change its type, position, or delete it.
</p>

<p>
The <u>Add</u> button allows you to add additional (secondary) roof structures to the model space.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Roof defined by an outline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another roof modeled by planes</p>
