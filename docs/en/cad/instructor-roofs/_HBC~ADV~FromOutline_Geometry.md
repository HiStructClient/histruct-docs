# Geometry

<p>Allows you to change the geometric parameters of the model, i.e., dimensions of the building and the roof, including the pitch and overhangs. It is also possible to set the type of roof assembly here.</p>

<p><b><u>Control buttons</u> modify the properties of the structure only on the selected roof or wall plane.</b></p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/Sheated_Building_Page_Building.png", "Dimensions", "Dimensions") }}

<p>The <u>Dimensions</u> button is used to define the floor plan shape of the object, set the height of the object and the pitch of the roof, and to add openings in the roof structure.</p>
<p>Basic floor plan dimensions can be entered either for the roof structure or for the vertical walls.</p>

<hr class="main">

<!--{{ box_icon("img/RoofSketchIcon64x64.png", "Roof", "Roof") }}

<p>The <u>Roof</u> button allows you to set the type of roof assembly. The roofing type and dimensions of the secondary roof structure can be changed via the <u>Sheeting</u> button.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/WallIcon64x64.png", "Walls", "Walls") }}

<p>The <u>Walls</u> button allows you to set the wall alignment method, the wall manufacturing type, the cladding row layout method, and the height of the plinth.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/DimensionLinearIcon64x64.png", "Anotate", "Anotate") }}

<p>The <u>Anotate</u> button allows you to add arbitrary floor plan dimensions to the model.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/TapeMeasureIcon64x64.png", "Measure", "Measure") }}

<p>The <u>Measure</u> button allows you to check the dimensions of the model.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/ControlButton.png", "", "Control button", width=64) }}

<!--<p><b><u>Control button on the roof plane</u></b> allows you to set the type of roof assembly for individual roof planes.</p>-->
<p><b><u>Control button on the wall plane</u></b> allows you to set wall alignment, production type, and row layout method. You can also disable the wall here.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/ControlButtonComponent.png", "", "Basic component control button", width=64) }}

<p><b><u>Basic wall component control button</u></b> allows you to set the production type and the way the wall is divided.</p>

<hr class="main">

{{ box_icon("img/ControlButtonComponentPart.png", "", "Divided component control button", width=64) }}

<p>Depending on the number of split levels of the original wall component, the component control button expandsâ€”this allows you to modify the same properties for the entire original wall component or its various parts, or to further split individual parts and create additional levels of the original wall component.</p>

<p>The lowest level of the divided component is controlled using the central part of the button, while the other levels are always controlled using the outer parts around the perimeter of the button.</p>
