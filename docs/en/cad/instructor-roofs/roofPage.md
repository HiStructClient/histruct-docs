# Roof

This tab is a key element for complete roof modelling, it offers two important buttons - *Surfaces* and *Levels* that allow you to easily and efficiently design the roof to your liking.

**The *Sheeting*** button opens the door to insert a complete gutter system or any flashing from our extensive range. It allows you to add not only a functional but also an aesthetic element to any roof.

**The *Surfaces*** button allows you to insert individual roof planes with ease. Simply select the type and create your roof step by step.

In addition, if you have documents in DXF or PDF format, feel free to insert them into the modeling space.
