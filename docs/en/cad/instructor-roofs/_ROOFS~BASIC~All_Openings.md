<h1>Openings</h1>

  <p>The <u><i>Openings</i></u> menu allows you to create and edit openings on individual roof planes. Each available type of opening can also be assigned a color.</p>

  <p><b>Settings and modifications of openings on individual roof planes can be made using the <u>Control Button</u>.</b></p>

  <p>Openings created in the section <u><i>Geometry &gt; Dimensions &gt; Opening</i></u> can only be edited in the menu <u><i>Geometry &gt; Dimensions</i></u>. This mainly concerns roof structure models of the FROM OUTLINE type created using a roof outline, or models of the BY PLANES type created using roof planes.</p>

  <hr class="main">

  {{ box_icon("img/ColorsIcon64x64.png", "Default colors", "Default colors", fontSize=10) }}

  <p>With the <u>Default colors</u> button, you can set default colors for selected types of openings.</p>

  <hr class="main">

  {{ box_icon("img/ControlButton.png", "", "Control Button", width=64) }}

  <p>The <u>Control Button</u> allows you to add an opening to the selected roof plane and choose its type.</p>

  <p>After clicking on the new opening in the model, you can perform the following modifications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Change its dimensions, color, and position within the given plane by overwriting the relevant values in the open table.</p></li>
    <li><p>You can also change the dimensions and position directly in the model using the mouse.</p></li>
  </ul>
