# Sheeting &gt; Wall

<p>In the <u><i>Sheeting > Wall</i></u> menu, you can set the wall production type, the arrangement of cladding rows, and the plinth height. It is also possible to modify individual cladding layers here.</p>

<p>For individual walls, you can also modify the color scheme and materials for each cladding layer. It is also possible to generate a bill of materials for cladding items or a view of the wall in the form of an editable drawing.</p>

<p><b>Settings and modifications for individual wall planes can be made using the <u>Control and Edit buttons</u>.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Through the <u>Control buttons</u> in the model, you can set the cladding type of the wall, the type and dimensions of secondary structure elements separately for each wall plane; they also allow material reports and wall structure drawings to be created.</p></li>
  <li><p>Through the <u>Edit buttons</u> in the model, you can edit the properties of individual wall construction layers on a given wall plane; they also allow the creation of material reports and drawings for the respective wall structure layers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting Wall Sheeting Layers</h2>

<p>Setting up the composition of the wall structure is done using the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><u>Top Layer</u></p></li>
  <li><p><u>Inner Layers</u></p></li>
  <li><p><u>Plinth</u></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
For some cladding types, the <u>Inner Layers</u> button may be hidden by default, and the secondary structure then is not generated for that cladding type.
</p>

<p>The <u>Plinth</u> button is available depending on the wall production type set in <u>Layout</u>.
