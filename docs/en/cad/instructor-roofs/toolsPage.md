# Tools
Extend your control over your model with our useful tools. Need to check any dimension in your model? The [measure tool](measureTool.md) is ideal for this task. The second useful feature on this tab is the ability to insert work planes. This tool is especially useful if you want your cursor to snap only to objects in the same plane. Get full control over every detail of your model!
