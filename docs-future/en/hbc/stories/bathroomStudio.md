# Story: bathroom studio

A company that manufactures and sells sanitary ware needed to build a demonstration studio and bathroom showroom as quickly as possible. The building was to be located in a pedestrianised shopping area.

> "*The HiStruct configurator helped us to get a fairly clear idea of how best to integrate the showroom into the surrounding development*," says the company's sales director, explaining the undeniable advantage of the configuration option.

The building's main wall faces the street. Glass storefronts are placed in the façade for an effective appearance.

To better integrate the building into the surrounding buildings, the façade is raised into the attic. The entrance doors are set into tapered modules 3m wide. This conveniently divides the building into three units that can have different uses.
