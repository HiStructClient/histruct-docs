## Windows and doors
The windows in the lobby are primarily for natural light and ventilation. The location and number of windows should be chosen to ensure sufficient light in the hall while minimizing the negative effects of sunlight and heat on the interior environment of the hall.

Doors are used for the entry and exit of people and materials from the hall. The location and number of doors should be chosen to ensure safety and operational requirements. Entrance doors should be located in such a place that they are easily visible and accessible to visitors and employees. Production doors should be located near work areas where machinery and equipment are located to ensure easy and quick loading and unloading of materials.

## Sectional and sliding doors
Sectional doors are a popular choice for industrial halls and warehouses because they are easy to operate and allow for efficient use of space. Their size should be large enough to allow the largest vehicles that will be used in the space to pass through.

Sliding doors slide along the wall and are often used to enter smaller warehouses or garages. These doors can be operated manually or electrically and are available in a variety of designs and materials.

## Rooflights
Rooflights allow natural lighting of the interior space and reduce energy costs. The most commonly used rooflights include transparent panels or roof and ridge skylights.
