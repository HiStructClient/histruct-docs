# Step 6 - Selecting the type of construction

## Material of construction
When designing and building a hall, it is important to consider the appropriate material of construction. There are three basic types of construction materials that are typically used in the construction of halls - steel, wood, concrete.

Steel structures are lightweight, easy to assemble and have a high load-bearing capacity and are the most common type of hall structure.

Timber structures are lightweight, easy to fabricate and assemble and are suitable for smaller spans with low height. Glulam beams are another option.

Concrete structures are very strong and resistant to damage from water and fire. They are suitable for larger spans with fire resistance requirements.

When selecting the material of construction, it is important to consider overall cost, material availability, functionality, load capacity, durability, and aesthetics. Each material has advantages and disadvantages and the choice depends on the specific needs and requirements of the customer.

## Thin-walled steel profile construction
Cold-formed thin-walled profiles are a type of steel profiles that are manufactured from rolled sheet metal. The profiles have high strength and stiffness and are suitable for use in primary structural members such as columns, trusses and trusses. Cold-formed thin-walled sections are lightweight and easy to assemble, allowing for rapid construction.
The advantage of using cold-formed thin-walled sections is the high load-bearing capacity and structural rigidity at a relatively low weight. The profiles also have a high resistance to deformation and exhibit minimal shrinkage and expansion with temperature changes.

## Rolled steel profile construction
Rolled sections have excellent load-bearing capacity and stability and are suitable for all types of indoor construction. The use of rake beams is common, which have excellent load-bearing capacity and are suitable for large halls and industrial buildings. These structures are usually lighter than structures made only of rolled steel sections, which reduces transport and installation costs.

The price of rolled steel sections depends on their size, geometry and material thickness. Steel sections are relatively heavy and expensive to transport and assemble. They have the advantage of high load-bearing capacity and long service life, which means they are an economical solution for buildings that will be used for a long time.

Overall, rolled steel sections are suitable for large halls and industrial buildings that require high load-bearing capacity and strength. Compared to other types of structures such as precast concrete trusses or glulam timber beams, steel tilt-up structures are usually cheaper and quicker to erect.

## Glued laminated timber beam construction
Glued laminated timber beams are made by bonding several layers of timber slats together with a waterproof adhesive under high pressure and temperature. The result is a material with high load-bearing capacity, stability and resistance to moisture and deformation.

The price of glued laminated timber beams and columns depends on the type of timber used, the specific dimensions and geometry of the beams and columns, and the complexity of their processing. These structures have a lower load-bearing capacity than steel structures, but are much lighter and easier to process. However, timber slat beams are also environmentally friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

Overall, glulam timber beams and columns are a good choice for smaller and medium-sized halls that do not require extreme load-bearing capacity and stability. Glued laminated timber has the advantage of lightness and ease of processing, as well as environmental and aesthetic properties.

## Concrete construction
Precast concrete trusses and columns are manufactured in concrete batching plants and then transported to the site where they are assembled into their final position. These precast elements have many advantages such as speed and ease of erection, minimal environmental impact during manufacture and high resistance to fire and degradation.

Precast concrete trusses and columns are suitable for use in primary concrete structures such as columns, trusses and trusses. These elements have high strength and stiffness and are capable of carrying high loads. The use of precast concrete allows for a very stable and strong structure that will last for many years.

Another advantage of using precast concrete trusses and columns is the ability to use computer modelling and analysis to design the structure. This process allows the optimum size of the precast elements to be accurately calculated and the safety of the structure to be guaranteed.

Overall, the use of precast concrete trusses and columns for the primary structure of the hall is a suitable and efficient choice that allows for fast and accurate construction with high load-bearing capacity and stiffness.

## Price aspect
The cost aspect of selecting a structure for the primary support structure of a hall is a key decision factor for most investors. The following comparison compares the prices of timber construction, thin-walled steel section construction, rolled steel section construction and concrete construction.

Timber construction is generally the cheapest option. The price of timber construction depends on the type of timber used, the specific dimensions and geometry of the beams and columns, and the complexity of their workmanship. However, timber construction has a lower load-bearing capacity and less stability than concrete and steel construction.

Thin-walled steel section construction is usually more expensive than timber construction but cheaper than rolled steel section and concrete construction. The price depends on the thickness and type of steel, the length of the profiles, the geometry and the difficulty of erection. Thin-walled steel section construction has a lower load capacity and less stability than rolled steel section construction or concrete construction.

Rolled steel section construction and concrete construction are the most expensive options. The price depends on the thickness and type of steel or concrete, the length of the profiles or dimensions of the precast elements, the geometry and the difficulty of installation. These structures have the highest load-bearing capacity and stability, making them ideal for large industrial buildings such as warehouses.

Overall, timber construction is the cheapest option but has lower load-bearing capacity and stability than other options. Thin-walled steel profile structures are more affordable than concrete and steel structures, but have lower load-bearing capacity and stability. Rolled steel profile and concrete structures are the most expensive but have the highest load capacity and stability. Therefore, when selecting a structure for the primary load-bearing structure of a hall, the price should be considered in accordance with the required load-bearing capacity and stability of the structure.

## Foundations
Foundations are an important part of any building, including halls. They ensure that the weight of the building is transferred to a solid base and provide stability to the structure. Several factors need to be considered when designing foundations, such as soil type and quality, building load, surrounding environment and other factors.
