# Step 1 - Requirements

For the correct design of the steel hall building, it is important to carefully consider the hall's dimensional requirements. These requirements can be influenced by many factors such as the purpose of the hall, material storage requirements, operational requirements and budget.

## Purpose of the hall

The purpose of the hall will be a major factor in determining the required size and height of the hall. If it is for materials storage, it will be important to consider not only the storage requirements of the materials themselves, but also the handling requirements, such as the required distances between racks and the height of the racks. If the hall is to be used for production, not only will the storage requirements for raw materials and finished products need to be considered, but also the requirements for production lines and handling space.

## Operation

Another factor that affects the dimensions of the hall is the operational requirements. These may include, for example, requirements for entrances and exits to and from the hall, parking and truck handling requirements, space requirements for staff, offices and sanitary facilities.

## Dimensions
The correct design of steel hall dimensions depends on many factors such as the purpose of the hall, storage and handling requirements, operational requirements and budget. It is important to carefully consider all these factors and design hall dimensions that will meet all requirements while being affordable. Also consider what other items you may have to store in the future. Once you have a clear idea of the hall's size requirements, you can start working on the plans and design. This process includes choosing a suitable site for the shed, deciding on the type of steel structure, the method of cladding and more.

## Location
The orientation of the hall should be the most efficient for your needs. Choose length and height based on site options, access areas, landscape features, existing development, etc. Do not forget about the convenience of entering and leaving the hall. If possible, it is advisable to locate the dominant side of the hall on the south facing side. This will get the greatest solar gain from the glazed openings. Photovoltaic panels can then be placed on the south-facing roof.

## Shape
The most common shape of a shed is a rectangular plan. However, extensions and various roofs are often added to the main building to extend the hall area by a fully or partially clad space.

## Budget
Budget will of course also be an important factor. The larger and more complex the hall, the higher the cost of materials, construction, transportation and installation will be. In this case, it will be necessary to consider whether the budget is sufficient to build the required hall and if not, whether a solution can be found that will be affordable.
