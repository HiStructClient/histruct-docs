# Step 7 - Submit an enquiry

In order to get a good deal on a hall, it is important to have a clear idea of the requirements and needs that the hall should meet. It is then advisable to contact several hall suppliers and ask them for a proposal and quote based on your specifications.

It is also good to remember that the price of a hall depends not only on its dimensions and the materials used, but also on other factors such as location, terrain, the need for special measures to ensure stability or the requirements for installing additional accessories.

It is therefore important to obtain several quotations from different suppliers and compare them with regard to requirements, quality of materials, delivery times and overall price. When selecting a supplier, it is also important to take into account their experience, reference projects and the way in which the installation and erection of the hall is arranged.
