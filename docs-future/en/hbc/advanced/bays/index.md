# Modules

Prefabricated halls are generally designed using a structure composed of main frames. The positioning of the main frames is then based not only on functional requirements but also on the requirements arising from the type of cladding chosen, or the ability of the cladding and secondary load-bearing structure to transfer the load to the main load-bearing frames and then to the foundations.
