# Positioning of main frames

The positioning of the main frames is partly defined by the shape of the hall. According to the direction of the ridge, the gable walls are evaluated and the main frames are placed in them. Additional frames are then generated between these gable walls according to the default maximum frame spacing settings. The number and placement of main frames can be changed via the buttons at the gable walls. It is possible to specify the number of frames and the distances between them.
