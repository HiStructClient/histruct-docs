# Default settings

By default, the configurator designs the geometry of the internal layout through the following parameters:

* Maximum column spacing in the space
* Maximum distance of columns in the wall
* Maximum distance of main frames

These parameters are accessed via a button in the middle of the hall, and when changed, they force a re-generation of the modules and other dependent parts of the parametric hall model. The spaces defined by the columns (fields) are used for entering openings and accessories. Therefore, a change in the module settings will also force changes in the positions of the windows and accessories entered on the fields on the respective [Openings](../openings/index.md) and [Accessories](../accesories/index.md) tabs and any mapping.

We describe the mapping of openings and accessories in more detail [here](../openings/mappingAtResizing.md)
