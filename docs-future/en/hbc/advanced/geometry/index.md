# Geometry

Similar to the basic control level, the dimensions of the rectangular hall and the roof type can be specified. In addition, the Roof Type - General option is available for the roof, which allows detailed settings of roof planes and therefore more than two roof planes.

The control setting is the number of roof planes.

In more detailed settings, the width, slope and direction of the roof plane can then be set. The sum of the widths of the roof planes must match the total width of the hall.

Using the general roof setup, we can then create an asymmetrical gable roof.

Extending the floor plan of the hall also offers more possibilities. A button on each wall of the hall provides a menu of possible extensions. The dimension of the extension, annex or building to be connected is then entered as an offset from the dimension of the existing wall to which the building is connected.

## Building extension
Building extensions can be inserted on each of the main walls, further extending the floor plan of the hall.

## A section of the building
Conversely, the building cutout means the floor plan of the hall is reduced, the roofing of this space remains unchanged.

## Roof extension
This setting increases the roofed area near the hall. This extension can only be specified on side (eaves) walls.

## Extension
Unlike previous expansions, this one will allow you to add additional space to the hall with a roof on a different level.

## Open annexe
Unlike previous expansions, this one will allow you to add an additional space to the hall with a roof on another level without cladding.

## Building
The option to connect another building is only enabled for gable walls on specific templates.
