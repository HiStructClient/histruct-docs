# Wall panel settings

Each wall panel can be selected via the context button on the outside of the panel, and a specific color can be selected for both the interior and exterior surface of that panel.
The wall panel is subordinate to [wallSegment](wallSegment.md).

You can create arbitrary color combinations this way.
