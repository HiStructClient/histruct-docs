# Roof settings

The configurator allows you to set the sheathing for the roof. You can choose between thermally insulated or non-insulated sheathing. Insulated sheathing offers options for a PUR sandwich panel or a membrane roof. A membrane roof consists of a trapezoidal sheet, insulation and a membrane. The thickness of the thermal insulation and the type of trapezoidal sheet can be selected. The membrane roof type is suitable in combination with the attic on the walls.

For non-insulated halls, the profile of the metal cladding, trapezoidal or corrugated sheet can be selected.
