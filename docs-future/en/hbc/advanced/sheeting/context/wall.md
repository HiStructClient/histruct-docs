# Wall geometry settings

The wall is the main part of the wall sheathing, which can consist of multiple [wall parts](wallPart.md).

## Setting the wall type
This menu allows you to select in particular the wall type - wall with or without plinth and, if applicable, the height of the plinth.

## Modifying the top of the wall
Additionally, you can choose to modify the wall at the top:
* _default_ - the wall is tightened under the roof, the roof has an overlap over the edge of the wall

* _adjust height_ - attic wall with fixed height. The height of each attic wall can then be selected for a single wall selection

* _set overhang_ - an attic wall with a fixed overhang above the roof plane. The attic follows the shape of the roof at the contact with the wall.

## Setting the plinth
In addition to curtain walls, volumetric walls made of concrete or masonry can be selected and their thickness and colour can be adjusted.
For halls with plinths, it is possible to set the thickness of the plinth and any eccentricity outwards (positive values) or inwards (negative values).
