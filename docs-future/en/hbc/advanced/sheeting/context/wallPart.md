# Sheathing of wall part

The wall piece is part of the wall. For example, if a wall is composed of a plinth and a cladding section, it has two wall sections. The wall part can be subdivided by user input into [wall strips](wallStrip.md).

## Dividing into wall strips
By default, the division into strips is not used. However, it can be divided by user input.

Example of a curtain wall divided into 2 wall strips:

A solid wall or plinth can be divided in a similar way.

Other settings apply to all subordinate wall strips:

 - [Wall Sheathing](../mainSettings.md)
 - [Wall panel placement](../wallOrientation.md)
 - [Color schemes for horizontally laid panels](../wallColorSchemeHorizontal.md)
 - [Color schemes for vertically laid panels](../wallColorSchemeVertical.md)
 - [Secondary constructions](../wallSecondary.md)
