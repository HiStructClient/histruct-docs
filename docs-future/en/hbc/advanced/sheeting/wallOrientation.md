# Laying panels on walls

## Panel laying direction
The wall cladding allows you to set the direction of the panels and, if necessary, to centre and offset the start of the panels.

### Vertical panel laying direction +Y and -Y
The panels are always laid from one direction in the local coordinate system of the segment being laid.

### Horizontal placement direction +X and -X
Panels are always laid from one direction in the local coordinate system of the laid segment.

### General laying direction
Panels are always laid from one direction in the local coordinate system of the laid segment rotated by the specified rotation angle.

## Setting the start of the placement
This option can be used to influence the placement of the origin for laying panels, especially for the vertical laying direction.
The _Center Panels on Axis_ option forces the panel placement to the center of the segment, while the _Center Panels on Edge_ option places the panel edge at the center of the segment.

Additionally, it is possible to generally shift the start of panel placement by a specified value.
