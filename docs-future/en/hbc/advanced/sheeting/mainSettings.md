# Main cladding settings

This setting is then applied to all buildings and their walls. Changing the settings for a specific wall or part of a wall can then be achieved via the context button menu in the model ([Context Curtainwall Settings](context/index.md)).

## Wall and plinth geometry settings
Setting the wall geometry consists mainly of selecting the wall type and setting its geometry.

This setting is similar to setting a specific wall:
