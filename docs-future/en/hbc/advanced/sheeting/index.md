# How to set the cladding on a parametric model

The sheathing configurator works on a parametric model whose geometry is generated from the dimensions and possible extensions of the plan outline entered in the previous steps. The individual walls take into account the positions of the main frames of the structure, the location and size of openings and the geometry of the roof planes.

In general, the hall cladding configurator allows to set the input in a cascade of dependencies, where the cladding for the whole hall can be set at the top end ([Main Settings on the _Cladding_ tab](mainSettings.md)), which is then applied to all child walls and wall sections. However, each wall can also have its own cladding setting, which is then applied to its child walls. A similar cascading principle is applied to all parts of the hall cladding.
