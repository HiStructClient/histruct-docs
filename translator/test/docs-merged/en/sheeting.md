# Sheathing

To configure the external fa√ßade, colour, element orientation, etc., different types of insulation panels, their orientation and colour can be selected on the Cladding tab.

## Setting the wall geometry
This menu allows you to select, in particular, walls with or without plinth and, where appropriate, the height of the plinth.

## Curtain wall settings
Here you can select specific sheathing for the walls of the hall. The choice between insulated and non-insulated hall is important. Of the thermal insulation cladding, there are options for PUR sandwich panels and a cassette system. When using PUR sandwich panels, the direction of installation can be further selected. In some cases, horizontally laid PUR panels may not need to be mounted on stubs and can therefore be a more economical choice. When laid horizontally, the panels are automatically divided into segments according to the position of the columns.

## Roof sheathing settings
The configurator allows you to set the sheathing for the roof. You can choose between thermally insulated or non-insulated sheathing. Insulated sheathing offers options for a PUR sandwich panel or a membrane roof.
A membrane roof consists of a trapezoidal sheet, insulation and a membrane. The thickness of the thermal insulation and the type of trapezoidal sheet can be selected. This type of roof is suitable in combination with an attic on the walls.

For non-insulated halls, the profile of the metal cladding, trapezoidal or corrugated sheet can be adjusted.

For both types of cladding it is possible to adjust the colour of the external surface of the cladding.
